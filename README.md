## Alfred (with Powerpack)

### What does it do?

**It boosts your productivity on macOS.** There are many cool features coming with with [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/): Snippets (used be to part of Clipboard), Terminal / Shell, Workflow, etc. Take Snippets for example: when we want to paste a piece of pre-written snippet, let’s say, into an input field on a webpage, such as some organization’s address or some text templates you don’t want to type again and again, all you need to do is 

1. evoke Alfred Snippets with hotkey (<kbd>opt</kbd> +  <kbd>cmd</kbd> +  <kbd>C</kbd> in Alfred 2)
2. type in the keyword for that snippet
3. hit <kbd>return</kbd> and then the snippet text is magically pasted into the input box

rather than 

1. open up a Word document or text file or Stickies app
2. scroll up and down to locate the snippet
3. copy it 
4. go back to the browser
5. paste it
6. finally close up the document full of snippets
 
But the most charming part of Powerpack is the Workflows. With Workflows, users are able to run a repeated sequence of tasks only with a two-or-three-character command typed in, and there are [tons of well-crafted workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) in the community can boost users’ productivity in different scenarios.

## ShiftIt

### What does it do?

Remember the awkward moments when you

- split screen but could not find the second window you want to display
- dragged the corner of the window to resize it when you do the presentation
- jumped among different windows to fill out a form

They are gone if you start using ShiftIt! 

> [ShiftIt] provides a set of actions that manipulates windows positions and sizes.

With ShiftIt, You can easily 

- make the current window maximum-sized on the screen (you can still see the close window button, minimize window button, and enter full screen button): <kbd>ctl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> +  <kbd>cmd</kbd>  +  <kbd>M</kbd>
- make current window take up left/right-half screen: <kbd>ctl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd><-</kbd>/<kbd>-></kbd>
- make current window take up top-left/top-right/bottom-left/bottom-right quarte screen: <kbd>ctl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>/<kbd>2</kbd>/<kbd>3</kbd>/<kbd>4</kbd>
- increment/decrement current window size: <kbd>ctl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>
- etc.

Especially useful when you don't have multiple monitors around you. Play around with it and you will love it!
